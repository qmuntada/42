wolf3d

Change the define in wolf.h to switch X11 version (LINUX or MAC)

If you think mouse movement is too fast, you can adjust it in wolf.h :
	just modify the # define RSPEED "ADJUSTED VALUE"

Modifying the other defines is not advised so do it at your own risk !
(harmless defines : GRAVITY WIDTH HEIGHT)

You can also customize the map or even make one yourself !

Have fun !
